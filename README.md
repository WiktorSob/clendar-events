# About

Idea for this project emerged from increasing frustration caused by stucking in traffic related to cultural events organized by sports hall in my hometown.
As a solution, I've created a simple function that scrapes website with event's information and then adds them to my google calenar.
Finally, function has been set up to run automaticaly using Google Cloud Functions and Scheduler - it runs every 1st and 15th day of the month, keeping my frustration on an acceptable level.
